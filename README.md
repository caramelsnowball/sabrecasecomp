# Sabre Internship Case Competition Demo

A prototype for the 2017 Sabre intern case competition. This is a general solution for the problem of matching calls made to a support center with the employees best suited to handle them in order to optimize efficiency. It takes into account the average amount of time that each employee takes to handle calls of each of a number of call topics, the success rate of employees handling calls, and the relative scarcity of adept employees in order to route incoming calls to specific employees in a way that maximizes the overall efficiency of the call center.
